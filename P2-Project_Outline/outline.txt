Overview

    The idea for my project is to create an easy to use test creation website. I came up with this idea whilst attending community college. I found that a surprisingly high number of 
teachers administered tests that were lacking both visually and functionally. Between questions that spanned two pages and writing lines that were uneven, I'm sure a good number 
of these teachers were simply making the test documents in Microsoft Word or some other similar application. Even more common than this was tests that had mistakes in them,
and which I can only assume nobody wanted to go through the hastle of editing. 

    My website will allow teachers to create an account that they can save their tests under for easy recalling and editing. Furthermore it will make creating essay questions, multiple 
choice, fill in the blank, true-false, and other common test question formats easy to make. This should ease and expedite the process of creating tests for educators, as well as 
hopefully making the tests easier to understand for students. In addition to this website should have a user friendly way to print these tests.

Features

What I'll Have to Learn

    For this project I will have to learn how to format and print text based documents using java. Furthermore I will have to learn to make a user friendly user interface. Finally I may
have to brush up on my database skills.
